The purpose of this\n    class is to insure proper spacing while the HTML header tag will handle typography.</p>\n\n    <h3>Top Level error</h3>\n\n    <p>Individual input fields should present their own errors following the styles dictated for input components.  Fields with errors should always be accompanied by error text,\n    unless a top level error message is sufficient to understand and fix the problem(s).</p>\n\n    <p>Top level errors relevant to the form as a whole may be presented above the first input and below the form name.

Each form element must be contained within a container (e.g. div) with the class pe-form--group\n    added to insure proper spacing between form fields.  Form fields will occupy 100% of the form width and stack.</p>\n\n    <h3>Next/Submit button</h3>\n\n    <p>The Next/Submit button should start out as a default button and become a primary (pe-btn__primary) or a CTA (pe-btn__cta) once the form has been completely filled out.  Since\n    this change cannot be accomplished strictly via CSS, the application will need to detect the circumstances where the button will change upon form completion.</p>\n\n    <p>If the form is broken up into multiple pages, use a \"Continue\" or \"Next\" button to advance the form series.

Strategies in your designs.</p>\n\n    <h2>Grid structure</h2>\n    <p>The grid consists of four key parts: the Container, Container Margins, Columns, and Gutters.</p>\n\n    <p>All columns reside within the Container, which is located at the root level of a page. Depending on the breakpoint, the container will have Container Margins of various sizes. The container also has a maximum width property, beyond which only the container margins grow in size.</p>\n\n    <p>The container is divided into 12 proportional Columns which contain actual content. These are separated by Gutters of a fixed size (which varies based on the breakpoint again).</p>\n\n    <p>See the redlines for the exact dimensions of each feature at each breakpoint.</p>\n\n    <h2>Redline details</h2>\n    <p>Container: Maximum width of 1140px & always horizontally centered</p>\n\n    <p>Container Margins: ≥ 40px at Large and Extra Large breakpoints 20px at Small and Medium breakpoints 10px at Extra Small breakpoints</p>\n\n    <p>Gutters: 40px at Medium and larger breakpoints 20px at Small breakpoints 10px at Extra Small breakpoints</p>\n\n    <p>Columns: Equal widths, size determined by remaining space after accounting for the container width and gutter size</p>\n\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default GridPage;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./demo/demoPages/styles/GridPage.js","import React from 'react';\n\nconst eight = {paddingLeft: 8};\nconst sixteen = {paddingLeft: 16};\n\nconst PresentationStrategiesPage = () => (\n  <div style={{padding: 14}}>\n    <h1><a href=\"http://pearson-higher-ed.github.io/design/c/presentation-strategies/\">Presentation Strategies</a></h1>\n\n    <p>This component provides several standard strategies for presenting content within a layout template.\n        Layout Templates help you structure a page at a high level and chunk it into major layout areas.\n        Presentation strategies operate at one level lower, helping to actually fill out those layout areas\n        in a standard and rational way. </p>\n\n    <p>Feature List</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Support for common layout patterns</li>\n      <li>Full integration with the standard templates</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Usage Guidelines</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>All content within a template should specify a presentation strategy to use.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>Overview</h3>\n    <p>Each strategy defines the location of one or more content areas which should each contain a single piece of content.</p>\n\n    <h3>Stacking</h3>\n    <p>Similarly to the templates themselves, strategies can be combined into stacks within a given template area.</p>\n\n    <h3>Spacing</h3>\n    <p>Stacked strategies have the same spacing options as templates: Directly Adjoining, Small Gap, and Large Gap.</p>\n\n    <h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n    <p>Strategies don’t include inherent responsive behavior, preferring instead to leave that up to their containing templates.

larger SVG sprite, using the {`<use>`} tag and href attribute. In Internet Explorer 11 and the webkit version of some Androids default \"Chrome\" browser, this does not work due to a bug unless the sprite is actually on the HTML page where you want to use icons (as opposed to referencing the sprite from your filesystem).</p>\n\n    <p>The sprite is invisible on the page, however it is currently around 85kb large. Consumers of the SDK need to choose whether they want to</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>manually include the sprite at the top of their pages as simply an SVG tag (view source of this page)</li>\n      <li>use JavaScript to dynamically call add the sprite to the page</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>The advantage of the second method is that this treats the sprite file like any other external file: cachable. Adding 84kb to each page load (the first option) may affect users on slower connections, however it ensures the page never loads with a moment where icons do not appear.</p>\n\n    <p>To use the second method, include the JavaScript below to your page which uses icons. Ensure the path in the GET request is the right path for your sprite:</p>\n\n    <p className=\"code\">\n    {`if (!document.getElementById('pe-icons-sprite')) {`}\n      <div style={eight}>{`var pe_ajax=new XMLHttpRequest();`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`pe_ajax.open(\"GET\", \"/icons/p-icons-sprite-1.1.svg\", true);`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`pe_ajax.responseType=\"document\";`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`pe_ajax.onload=function(e) {`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`document.body.insertBefore(`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`pe_ajax.responseXML.documentElement,`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`document.body.childNodes[0]`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`);`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`}`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`pe_ajax.send();`}</div>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>If you are using Babel or other ES5-to-ES6 transpiler for your JavaScript, you may wish to change <b>{`var pe_ajax`}</b> to <b>{`const pe_ajax`}</b>.</p>\n\n    <p>Remember that JavaScripts version of attribute names are camel-cased. For example if you are writing an SVG in JSX or building one in vanilla JavaScript, the <i>{`xlink:href`}</i> of HTML is called <i>{`xlinkHref`}</i>.</p>\n\n    <h2>Making decorative icons</h2>\n\n    <p>Decorative icons are sitting next to visible text as a decoration to that text. If they were HTML images, their alt attributes would be \"\" (empty string).</p>\n\n    <h2 style={{color:'#db0020', backgroundColor:'pink', padding:5}}>\n      <svg style={{verticalAlign:'baseline'}}\n           aria-hidden=\"true\"\n           focusable=\"false\"\n           className=\"pe-icon--warning-18\">\n        <use xlinkHref=\"#warning-18\"></use>\n      </svg>\n      Warning! Stuff happened!\n    </h2>\n\n    {`<h2 style=\"color:#db0020;background-color:pink;padding:5px;\">`}\n      <div style={eight}>{`<svg style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"`}</div>\n           <div style={twntyFr}>{`aria-hidden=\"true\"`}</div>\n           <div style={twntyFr}>{`focusable=\"false\"`}</div>\n           <div style={twntyFr}>{`class=\"pe-icon--warning-18\">`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<use xlink:href=\"#warning-18\"></use>`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`</svg>`}</div>\n    {`Warning! Stuff happened!</h2>`}\n\n    <h2>Making stand-alone icons</h2>\n\n    <p>Stand-alone icons represent meaningful content on their own, and require their own internal alternative text. If they were HTML images, they would have alt=\"their meaning\". Examples include icons used instead of text inside actionable controls like buttons (see the <a href=\"../buttons\">buttons documentation</a>).</p>\n\n    <p>In order for the internal text to work in all assistive tech and browsers currently, a small hack is required: the `title` element must get an id (which of course must be unique on the page) and the `svg` element gets an `aria-labelledby` attribute pointing to that id. Text inside the `title` tag is not visible on the page. Additionally the role of \"img\" is added to ensure browsers expose the icon as an image.</p>\n\n    <button type=\"button\" className=\"pe-icon--btn\">\n      <svg role=\"img\"\n           aria-labelledby=\"r2\"\n           focusable=\"false\"\n           className=\"pe-icon--remove-sm-18\">\n        <title id=\"r2\">Close dialog</title>\n        <use xlinkHref=\"#remove-sm-18\"></use>\n      </svg>\n    </button> <br/>\n\n    {`<button type=\"button\" class=\"pe-icon--btn\">`}\n      <div style={eight}>{`<svg role=\"img\"`}</div>\n           <div style={twntyFr}>{`aria-labelledby=\"r2\"`}</div>\n           <div style={twntyFr}>{`focusable=\"false\"`}</div>\n           <div style={twntyFr}>{`class=\"pe-icon--remove-sm-18\">`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<title id=\"r2\">Close dialog</title>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<use xlink:href=\"#remove-sm-18\"></use>`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`</svg>`}</div>\n    {`</button>`}\n\n    <aside>\n      <h3 className=\"pe-title\">Change the path to the icon</h3>\n      <p>The default directory for the icon file is <code>../icons/</code>.</p>\n    </aside>\n\n    <h2>Adding new icons to ElementsSDK</h2>\n\n    <p>After a proposed icon has been accepted by the UX Framework team, an SVG can be created in whichever program you prefer. For a size-18 icon, set the viewBox attribute to \"0 0 18 18\". For the size-24 version, set the viewBox attribute to \"0 0 24 24\". This means if the icon you have created is a bit smaller either vertically or horizontally than those dimensions, empty space will be the result (and this is okay).</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Open the SVG icons file found in the `/assets/icons/` folder in a text editor</li>\n      <li>Open your new icon SVG file in a text editor</li>\n      <li>In the Elements icon file, insert a {`<symbol>`} tag with an id attribute matching the name of the new icon and its size; add in the viewBox attribute</li>\n      <p className=\"code\">Example: {`<symbol>`}<code>id=\"my-newIcon-18\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 18\" ... {`</symbol>`}</code></p>\n      <li>From your new icon, copy the &lt;path&gt; into the Elements file, inside the &lt;symbol&gt; tags.</li>\n      <li>Test your new icon out locally</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Do not forget to add the new icon to this page (not only in the list, but to update the main sprite in the docs.html page).</p>\n\n    <p>If you have generated an icon with the correct viewBox attribute and do not feel comfortable editing the Elements SVG file, send your icon file to the PDA team.</p>\n\n    <h2>Making icons accessible</h2>\n\n    <p>The major accessibility problem with icons in general is that users do not tend to know what they are or what they mean unless they are associated with a textual label. Textual labels particularly aid users with cognitive disabilities. This is especially important if the icons are the primary \"text\" of an interactive element (e.g. links, buttons).</p>\n\n    <h2>High Contrast</h2>\n\n    <p>When users turn on contrast settings (either in their OS or in their browsers), the `color` attribute on text switches automatically to comply with the new color scheme. However, hard-coded `fill` values in SVGs may not. To ensure SVG colors also switch with high contrast modes, in the CSS we've set the fill property to inherit from its parent element's color value. This means to have a specific color on any icon, developers should wrap it in something where they can set the appropriate color (usually, as in buttons, the icon does not differ from the surrounding text color).</p>\n\n    <p>The \"new-notification\" SVG as an example:</p>\n\n    <span style={{color:'#da0474'}}>\n      <svg role=\"img\"\n           aria-labelledby=\"r3\"\n           focusable=\"false\"\n           className=\"pe-icon--new-notification-9\">\n        <title id=\"r3\">New: </title>\n        <use xlinkHref=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>\n      </svg>\n    </span>\n\n    <p className=\"code\">\n      {`<span style=\"color:#da0474;\">`}\n        <div style={eight}>{`<svg role=\"img\"`}</div>\n             <div style={twntyFr}>{`aria-labelledby=\"r3\"`}</div>\n             <div style={twntyFr}>{`focusable=\"false\"`}</div>\n             <div style={twntyFr}>{`class=\"pe-icon--new-notification-9\">`}</div>\n          <div style={sixtn}>{`<title id=\"r3\">New: </title>`}</div>\n          <div style={sixtn}>{`<use xlink:href=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>`}</div>\n        <div style={eight}>{`</svg>`}</div>\n      {`</span>`}\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Speech recognition</h3>\n\n    <p>It is important to note that speech users (who interact with the page using voice commands) will not have access to the names of interactive elements whose text is visually hidden and only made available to screen readers. There are only a few icons where a user has a good chance of guessing the interactive elements name, such as \"close\" and \"search,\" so it is important to show visible names of interactive elements as much as possible.</p>\n\n    <h3>Screen readers</h3>\n\n    <p>Screen readers *may* alert their users to the existence of decorative SVGs. When the icon is purely decorative, add `aria-hidden=\"true\"` to the SVG to hide it from assistive technologies.</p>\n\n    <code>\n      &lt;svg <b>aria-hidden=\"true\"</b> <br/>\n           focusable=\"false\" <br/>\n           class=\"pe-icon--warning-18\"&gt; <br/>\n        &lt;use xlink:href=\"#warning-18\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt; <br/>\n      &lt;/svg&gt; <br/>\n    </code>\n\n    <p>Do not use this attribute for icons that are content! Those icons with text inside them should have `role=img` instead:</p>\n\n    <code>\n      &lt;svg <b>role=\"img\" <br/>\n           aria-labelledby=\"r3\"</b> <br/>\n           focusable=\"false\" <br/>\n           class=\"pe-icon--warning-18\"&gt; <br/>\n        <b>&lt;title id=\"r3\"&gt;Text here!&lt;/title&gt;</b> <br/>\n        &lt;use xlink:href=\"#warning-18\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt; <br/>\n      &lt;/svg&gt; <br/>\n    </code>\n\n    <p>The `aria-labelledby` is a fix for some older browsers and Assistive Tech, as is the role (some browsers and some AT see SVGs with other roles such as `diagram` or `group`).</p>\n\n    <h4>Assistive Tech support for SVG icons</h4>\n\n    <p>Browsers differ in how they present SVGs in general. Assistive technology (AT) is fairly dependent on the browser to give the user the correct awareness of what is available on a web page.</p>\n\n    <h5>Internet Explorer</h5>\n\n    <p>IE, up to and including version 11, implements parts of the Tiny SVG 1.2 spec which had a `focusable` boolean attribute for SVGs, for authors (developers) to state whether an SVG should be focusable. This spec never made it through. The upcoming SVG 2 spec will just use the normal `tabindex` attribute to set SVG focusability. Edge prior to version 14 used to support this `focusable` attribute, while later versions have removed this.</p>\n\n    <p>The upshot is that SVGs are in the tab order in IE by default, and causes keyboard users (including screen reader users) to have 2 tab stops when an icon is inside a control. Adding `focusable=\"false\"` to your SVGs takes care of this.</p>\n\n    <h5>Firefox</h5>\n\n    <p>Firefox (as last checked) does not appear to offer the names of the SVGs as names of controls when an SVG is inside a button for example. Normally the name of a control like a button comes from the content inside. However some screen readers (Orca on Linux, JAWS for Windows) are leaving the SVGs silent and consider the buttons unnamed. We are still investigating if this is fully a bug on Mozilla's part or Freedom Scientific's (makes of JAWS), but in the meantime if you have a JAWS users on Firefox, know that buttons and other controls with only an SVG icon will be considered unlabelled buttons. Either recommend to your JAWS users to use Internet Explorer or Chrome/chromium (both of these read out the SVGs fine), or you can turn your SVG icons into the \"decorative\" version (see examples above) and use `aria-label` (value is a string, don't forget to include localisation) on the control. Be aware that `aria-label` overrides all labels and text inside a control, and is only appropriate for things like buttons where no additional inner content is present.</p>\n\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default StylesIconsPage;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./demo/demoPages/styles/StylesIconsPage.js","import React from 'react';\n\nconst eight = {paddingLeft: 8};\nconst sixtn = {paddingLeft: 16};\nconst twntyFr = {paddingLeft: 24};\n\nconst StylesInputsPage = () => (\n  <div style={{padding: 14}}>\n    <h1><a href=\"http://pearson-higher-ed.github.io/design/c/inputs/\">Inputs</a></h1>\n    <p>An input is a field used to save a response from a user.</p>\n\n    <h2>Labels</h2>\n    <p>All inputs must have direct labels, even when the visual design such as the field being physically close to other text can give some users a good idea of what to fill in.

If the placeholder offers useful hints (such as the desired formatting of data), consider adding this as info text under the input and linked using `aria-describedby`, or adding it to the label (see <a href=\"https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/11/24/placeholder-text-think-outside-the-box/\">placing hints outside inputs</a>).</p>\n\n    <h2>Error states</h2>\n    <p>When someone has made an error, that error state should be clear and obvious, as well as what exactly the problem is. For some assistive tech users, we can programmatically associate an error message with its input using `aria-describedby`, and we can set the input&#39;s state with `aria-invalid`.</p>\n\n    <p>`aria-describedby`&#39;s value is the id of the element with the message you want to link. `aria-invalid` can either be used as a boolean, or it can have a type as a value (`aria-invalid=\"spelling\"` for example).</p>\n\n    <p>Be aware: hiding an error message that is present in the DOM using `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` will still have that error message read out to screen reader users when they focus on the input, even when the input is not in an error state.\n    The message or the input&#39;s `aria-describedby` link to the message cannot be present in the DOM until there *is* an error state. </p>\n\n    <p>When there is no error state, any of these techniques will work:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>leave the error message absent (empty element) until the input is shown invalid</li>\n      <li>don&#39;t have the error element present at all (appears when there&#39;s an error state)</li>\n      <li>don&#39;t have the error element have the matching id</li>\n      <li>don&#39;t have the error element&#39;s id in the `aria-describedby` value</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>The `aria-invalid` attribute should only be set to true *after validation*, not before.</p>\n\n    <h2>Inputs -

make a single choice among many options. Unlike a select box, all options are available and visible to all users at once.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Radio buttons are required to be inside a radio group (the most common example is a fieldset element where the fieldset&#39;s {`<legend>`} contains the subject the user is making a choice about).  They are required to have a label (which names the choice). Thus there is almost always a combination of a subject regarding the group (like a question), and a label per option.</li>\n      <li>Radio buttons within a radio group are also required to share the same `name` attribute. There cannot be only 1 radio button in a radio group.</li>\n      <li>It is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that one of the radio buttons are selected by default, rather than letting browsers choose to either pre-select the first item or leave them all unselected.</li>\n      <li>When a subject line and individual options, or using a fieldset/legend seem unnecessary for your question, consider using a select element instead.</li>\n      <li>When there is more than one option that could be selected, use checkboxes instead.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Example showing unselected, selected, and disabled unselected versions:</p>\n\n    <fieldset className=\"pe-fieldset\">\n      <legend>Which scotch do you like with your cookies?</legend>\n      <div className=\"pe-radio\">\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"scotch\" id=\"scotchTB\" />\n        <label htmlFor=\"scotchTB\">T&#233; Bheag (unselected)</label>\n        <span>\n          <svg aria-hidden=\"true\"\n               focusable=\"false\"\n               className=\"pe-icon--radio-dot\">\n            <use xlinkHref=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>\n          </svg>\n        </span>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"pe-radio\">\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"scotch\" id=\"scotchMS\" checked=\"checked\" />\n        <label htmlFor=\"scotchMS\">Monkey Shoulder (selected)</label>\n        <span>\n          <svg aria-hidden=\"true\"\n               focusable=\"false\"\n               className=\"pe-icon--radio-dot\">\n            <use xlinkHref=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>\n          </svg>\n        </span>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"pe-radio\">\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"scotch\" id=\"scotchT\" disabled />\n        <label htmlFor=\"scotchT\">Talisker 18 years (disabled unselected)</label>\n        <span>\n          <svg aria-hidden=\"true\"\n               focusable=\"false\"\n               className=\"pe-icon--radio-dot\">\n            <use xlinkHref=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>\n          </svg>\n        </span>\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n\n    <p className=\"code\">\n    {`<fieldset class=\"pe-fieldset\">`} <br/>\n      <div style={eight}>{`<legend>Which scotch do you like with your cookies?</legend>`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`<div class=\"pe-radio\">`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<input type=\"radio\" name=\"scotch\" id=\"scotchTB\">`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<label for=\"scotchTB\">T&#233; Bheag (unselected)</label>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<span>`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" class=\"pe-icon--radio-dot\">`}</div>\n            <div style={{paddingLeft: 32}}>{`<use xlink:href=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`</svg>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`</span>`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`</div>`}</div>\n\n      <div style={eight}>{`<div class=\"pe-radio\">`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<input type=\"radio\" name=\"scotch\" id=\"scotchMS\" checked=\"checked\">`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<label for=\"scotchMS\">Monkey Shoulder (selected)</label>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<span>`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" class=\"pe-icon--radio-dot\">`}</div>\n            <div style={{paddingLeft: 32}}>{`<use xlink:href=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`</svg>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`</span>`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`</div>`}</div>\n\n      <div style={eight}>{`<div class=\"pe-radio\">`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<input type=\"radio\" name=\"scotch\" id=\"scotchT\" disabled>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<label for=\"scotchT\">Talisker 18 years (disabled unselected)</label>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`<span>`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" class=\"pe-icon--radio-dot\">`}</div>\n            <div style={{paddingLeft: 32}}>{`<use xlink:href=\"#new-notification-9\"></use>`}</div>\n          <div style={twntyFr}>{`</svg>`}</div>\n        <div style={sixtn}>{`</span>`}</div>\n      <div style={eight}>{`</div>`}</div>\n    {`</fieldset>`}\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Accessibility Concerns</h3>\n\n    <p>There can be times when a developer cannot have a fieldset+legend but must for some reason use radio buttons. It is possible to use another wrapping element, such as a div, with `role=radiogroup` set on it. Additionally for the legend text, if there is nearby text that is visually being relied upon to do the question/subject work, giving that element a unique id can allow you to add `aria-describedby=\"that unique id\"` on your div.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"cookiemonster\">Cookies</h2>\n    <div role=\"radiogroup\" aria-describedby=\"cookiemonster\">\n      <div

<h1><a href=\"http://pearson-higher-ed.github.io/design/c/tables/\">Tables</a></h1>\n\n    <p>Use tables to display tabular data. For simply laying things out in a visual grid form, use CSS instead (and ensure any focusables follow visual tab order if you do).</p>\n    <p>Tables should have either a heading above them, or a caption element, giving them their name/basic description.</p>\n\n    <h2>Basic Tables</h2>\n    <p>All tables will have:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>some kind of name such as a caption or heading (may not always be visible)</li>\n      <li>a &lt;thead&gt; element with table headers</li>\n      <li>column and (possible) row headers are &lt;th&gt; elements and have a <code className=\"code\">scope</code> attribute</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>Captions and toolbars</h3>\n\n    <p>Any captions or toolbars, above or below tables, have a distance of 28px from the table. To ensure this, use the following class names:</p>\n\n    <p>If you&#39;re using an actual table <code className=\"code\">&lt;caption&gt;</code> tag in our `pe-table` table, the caption will be on top and already have the correct distance.
